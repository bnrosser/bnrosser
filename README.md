Hello there! Im Brandi!

Prior to diving head first into the tech industry I was a Marine Corps helicopter mechanic on the MV-22 Ospreys! I have a very heavy mechanical and maintenance background including hydraulic servicing, sheet metal and carbon fiber repairs, aircraft paint touch up and markings, automotive component assembly, and CNC machining.
