Hello there! Im Brandi!

Prior to diving head first into the tech industry I was a Marine Corps helicopter mechanic on the MV-22 Ospreys! I have a very heavy mechanical and maintenance background including hydraulic servicing, sheet metal and carbon fiber repairs, aircraft paint touch up and markings, automotive component assembly, and CNC machining.

I have always had an interest in computers and the tech world in general. During my time in the Marine Corps I would always be looking up things that I could learn online having to do with coding and other subjects. After I left the Marine Corps I entered the work force, but always wanted to pursue a career in the tech field. I am currently enrolled full time online at Wake Tech Community College. My current course of study is a hybrid program aimed at completing and receiving my “Cyber Operations and Digital Forensics” and “Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking” certificates. Follow on study will be to complete my AAS in Cyber Security. I am on track to complete my certificate programs by May 8th, 2024. I have consistently been at the top of my class, always maintaining a spot on the Presidents/Deans list. Knowledgeable in HTML and CSS. I have taken classes in Python Programming. I am ready to take what I have learned and build upon those skills with some hands on experience in the job market. 

I have already taken classes in:

* Web, Program, and Database Foundation
* Linux/Unix single user and scripting
* Python Programming
* Network and Security Foundations
* Operating Systems Concepts
* Security Concepts
* and more!
